1. In the Code, we have the loaded data for the employees and their amount
2.we have created the data frame by using the sparkSession
3.we have grouped the particular column named first and summed the amount column
4. we have taken the total_amount and created the alternative column called total_Avg
5. we have divided the total_amount by the total_avg to find out the Opted average

##########################################################
we have implemented the opitmisation here
By setting the Initial Number of partition to certain number
By setting the Number of parallelism to false
as we are willing to achieve the best in terms of partitions rather than the utilizing the cores
